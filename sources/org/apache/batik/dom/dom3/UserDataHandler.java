/**
 * When associating an object to a key on a node using 
 * <code>Node.setUserData()</code> the application can provide a handler 
 * that gets called when the node the object is associated to is being 
 * cloned, imported, or renamed. This can be used by the application to 
 * implement various behaviors regarding the data it associates to the DOM 
 * nodes. This interface defines that handler.
