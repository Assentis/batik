    <p>
      This page contains information on the current work that is being done
      in Batik's Subversion repository in preparation for the next release.  
      There are currently four main branches in the repository:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>trunk</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          The
          <a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/xmlgraphics/batik/trunk">trunk</a>
          is the main development branch.  All bug fixes and most new
          non-experimental features are checked in to this branch.  While it is
          the bleeding edge of the available Batik code, it is generally stable
          enough to use.  For more information on SVG 1.2 features that are
          supported by the trunk, see the
          <a href="site:svg12status">SVG 1.2 status</a> page.
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt>anim</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          The
          <a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/xmlgraphics/batik/branches/anim">anim</a>
          branch is where the preliminary work on SMIL animation support is
          done.  When this code has reached a level where it can reliably
          support some basic animation functionality, it will be folded back
          into the trunk.  See the <a href="site:animation">SMIL animation</a>
          page for details.
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt>webapi</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          The
          <a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/xmlgraphics/batik/branches/webapi">webapi</a>
          branch is where some experimental support for some of the work being
          produced by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2006/webapi/">Web API
            WG</a> (specifically, support for
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest">XMLHttpRequest</a> and
          the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/Window">Window object</a>).  When
          the specifications and the implementation mature enough, the
          code will be folded back into the trunk.
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt>svg11</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          The
          <a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/xmlgraphics/batik/branches/svg11">svg11</a>
          branch contains the code that was the trunk before the old svg12
          branch became the trunk.  Bug fixes that are made on the trunk are
          also ported to the svg11 branch.  This branch will be deprecated at
          some point in the future.
