    <question>What is Batik?</question>
    <answer>
        <p>
        The goal of the Batik project is to provide a framework for Java language applications 
        which manipulate SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) content for various purposes, such as 
        generation, manipulation or viewing. 
        </p>
        <p>
        The project's ambition is to give developers a set of core modules which can be used together 
        or individually to support specific SVG solutions. Examples of modules are SVG parsers, SVG 
        generators and SVG DOM implementations. Even though the goal of the project is to provide a set 
        of core modules, one of the deliveries is a full fledged SVG Viewer implementation which 
        validates the various modules and their inter-operability.

    <question>Where does the name come from?</question>
    <answer>
        <p>
        Batik is one of Java's famous and highly developed art traditions.
        Batik is generally thought of as the most quintessentially Indonesian
        textile.
        </p>
        <p>
        Motifs of flowers, twinning plants, leaves buds, flowers, birds,
        butterflies, fish, insects and geometric forms are rich in symbolic
        association and variety; there are about three thousand recorded batik
        patterns.
        </p>
        <p>
        We think that Batik evokes gracefully Java, Graphics and High-quality,
        terms that consitute the core of the toolkit.
        </p>
    </answer>

    <question>How did it start?</question>
    <answer>
        <p>
        Batik started out because several teams doing SVG related projects decided to join 
        efforts with the idea that the whole will be greater than the sum of the parts. The
        following companies or institutions are part of the team that contributed and/or
        created the initial Batik project:
        <ul>
            <li><link href="http://www.csiro.au/">CSIRO</link></li>
            <li><link href="http://www.ilog.fr/">ILOG</link></li>
            <li><link href="http://www-sop.inria.fr/koala/jackaroo/">Jackaroo</link></li>
            <li><link href="http://www.kodak.com/">Eastman Kodak Company</link></li>
            <li><link href="http://www.sun.com">Sun Microsystems, Inc.</link></li>
        </ul>
        In addition, the Batik project is supported by <link href="http://www.ibm.com">IBM</link>.
        </p>
        <p>
        This is a lot of big companies: is Batik only for big companies? Certainly not!
        Even though some big companies are involved in Batik, the project is not limited
        to big corporations and, as all other Apache project, is opened to everyone based
        on merit.
        </p>

    <question>How can I contribute?</question>
    <answer>
        <p>
        The process for contributing to Batik is the same as for other Java projects 
        at Apache. A formal description of that process can be found, for example, on the 
        <link href="http://jakarta.apache.org/guidelines/index.html">Jakarta</link> web
        site.
        </p>
    </answer>

    <question>What can I do with Batik?</question>
    <answer>
        <p>
        Batik contains several modules that can be used independantly: an SVG parser,
        a object oriented vector tookit (GVT), a set of extensions to the Java 2D API
        (such as Paints and filters) and more.
        However, Batik comes with three applications: an SVG viewer (in the 
        org.apache.batik.apps.svgviewer package) an SVG rasterizer (in the 
        org.apache.batik.apps.rasterizer package) and an SVG Generator 
        (in the org.apache.batik.util.awt.svg package) that allows
        all Java applications to export their graphics to the SVG format. 
        </p>
        <p>
        The SVG viewer can display SVG documents and lets the user zoom, pan 
        and rotate any SVG document, view the SVG source, link between SVG 
        documents, view a tree representation of the SVG DOM and more.
        </p>
        <p>
        The SVG rasterizer lets the user convert SVG files to raster formats such
        as JPEG and PNG. It contains an extensible mechanism so that arbitrary
        raster formats can be added.
        </p>
        <p>
        The SVG generator lets all Java application export their graphics
        as SVG, with no more requirements than for drawing to the screen or
        for printing.
        </p>
        <p>
        These three applications show that Batik can be used client side (the viewer
        can be used on any client machine, and the SVG generator can be used in client
        desktop applications to export SVG) and server side (the rasterizer can be
        used to serve SVG images to client machines that do not have SVG support; the
        SVG generator can be used to dynamically generate SVG content on a server).
        </p>
        The SVG viewer and the rasterizer are only examples of the type of 
        applications Batik allows. Its architecture allows the different modules to
        be used in different ways and other applications are possible, such as 
        transcoders (to other vector formats, such as PDF, for example). Furthermore,
        the Graphic Vector Toolkit could be used to render other graphic format
        such as XHTML.
        </p>

    <question>Where can I find the SVG specification?</question>
    <answer>
        <p>
        The SVG specification is available from the 
        <link href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/">W3C Web site</link> 
        </p>
    </answer>

    <question>How can I create and author SVG content?</question>
    <answer>
        <p>
        Well, you can always use vi or xemacs, but there are many graphic
        authoring packages that can export SVG documents, such as Adobe Illustrator 9.
        You can get a list of tools that can export SVG from the 
        <link href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/SVG-Implementations#edit">implementation</link>
        section of the SVG Home page on the W3C web site.
        </p>
        <p>
        Authoring is one way of creating SVG content, and graphic authoring
        packages are useful for that purpose. However, there are many types
        of graphics which can be generated, such as stock quotes, statistical
        data, etc... For that type of graphics, there are many ways to generate
        SVG content. For example, if your data (say stock information) is contained
        in an XML document, you could use XSLT to transform your XML data into
        SVG. If your data comes from a data base and you retrieve that data
        in a servlet on a Web server (e.g., using JDBC), you could use the 
        Java binding for the DOM API to generate an SVG document from the 
        data base data. You could also use Batik's SVG generator and use the
        Java 2D API to generate that graphic.

    <question>What are the benefits of SVG being an XML grammar?</question>
    <answer>
        <p>
        Being an XML grammar gives SVG can leverage work done around XML, 
        and SVG actually leverages other grammars such as XLink and SMIL
        for the animation.
        </p>
        Beyond the use and mix with other XML syntaxes, being an XML grammer
        lets SVG benefit from the pletora of XML tools that make is so easy
        to manipulate, generate, search and edit SVG files.

    <question>What other SVG products are out there?</question>
    <answer>
        <p>
        There are many companies supporting SVG and you will find a list of 
        available implementations on the <link href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/SVG-Implementations">
        W3C's SVG implementation page</link>
        </p>
    </answer>

    <question>Why do we have such a project at Apache?</question>
    <answer>
        <p>
        Apache's mission is to allow the web to be an open environment and
        to remain an open environment. Batik is an open source implementation of
        a key format for today and tomorow's web and fits well in Apache's mission.
        </p>
    </answer>

    <question>How does Batik relate to other Apache projects?</question>
    <answer>
        <p>
        Batik will be merged with <link href="">Cocoon</link> for server side rasterization of 
        SVG images and will likely be used in <link href="">FOP</link> for converting
        SVG images to PDF.
        </p>
    </answer>

    <question>What is coming next?</question>
    <answer>
        <p>
        The SVG implementation is not complete, and there is more work to do to 
        achieve a fully functional viewer, especially in dynamic behavior (the 
        scripting support is not fully implemented yet and there is no SMIL 
        animation support yet).
        </p>
        <p>
        The type of applications (e.g., transcoding applications) that can or will
        be added to Batik depends on contributions and feedback.
        </p>
