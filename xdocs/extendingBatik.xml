        <s1 title="Introduction">
            <p>The goal of this section is to provide an overview of
               the built in extension mechanisms in Batik.  As an open
               source project, people can of course make any extension
               they feel is interesting, however Batik has been
               designed with several forms of extension in mind.</p>

            <p>The main areas extension are anticipated are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><link href="#customXMLTags"> 
                    Support for custom XML Tags
                    </link></li>
                <li><link href="#imageTagFormats"> 
                    Support for new file formats in the 'image' tag.
                    </link></li>
                <li><link href="#urlProtocols">
                    Support for new protocols in URL references.
                    </link></li>
                <li><link href="#transcoders">
                    Support for new Transcoders.
                    </link></li>
            </ul>

            <note>
            If you feel that we have overlooked an important area for
            extension please let your feelings be known on the mailing-lists.

        <s1 title="Custom XML Tags">
            <p>
            First one must ask "What does it mean to support custom 
            XML tags?"
            </p>
            <p>
            If your only interest if for the custom tags to appear in
            the SVG DOM tree, you need do nothing more than provide
            appropriate namespacing and DTD(s) (ie. simply make your
            new content well formed XML).  Batik will ignore the parts
            that aren't part of SVG.
            </p>

            <p>
            If your interest is in having the new tag participate in
            the generation of graphics then you must inform the Bridge
            about your new tags.
