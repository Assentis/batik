      <p>
        Use the links below to download the distributions of Batik
        from one of our mirrors.  It is good practice to <a
        href="[location]#Verify Releases">verify the integrity</a> of
        the distribution files, especially if you are using one of our
        mirror sites.  In order to do this you must use the signatures
        from our <a href="http://www.apache.org/dist/xml/batik/">main
        distribution directory</a> .
      </p>
      <p>
         Batik is only distributed as a <code>zip</code> archive.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you do not see the file you need in the links below, please
        see the <a href="http://www.apache.org/dist/xml/batik/">master
        distribution directory</a> or, preferably, its <a
        href="[preferred]/batik/">mirror</a>.

        You are currently using <b>[preferred]</b>.  If you encounter
        a problem with this mirror, please select another mirror.  If
        all mirrors are failing, there are <i>backup</i> mirrors (at
        the end of the mirrors list) that should be available.

    <s1 title="Old Batik Releases">
      <p>
        Older releases of Batik can be found 
        <a href="http://archive.apache.org/dist/xml/batik/">here</a>.  
        We highly recommend to not use those releases but upgrade to
        Batik's <a href="[location]#Current Release of Batik">latest</a>
        release.
    </p>
    </s1>
    <s1 title="Verify Releases">
      <p>
        It is essential that you verify the integrity of the
        downloaded files using the PGP or MD5 signatures.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PGP signatures can be verified using PGP or GPG.  First
        download the <a
        href="http://www.apache.org/dist/xml/batik/KEYS">KEYS</a> as well
        as the <code>asc</code> signature file for the particular
        distribution.  Make sure you get these files from the <a
        href="http://www.apache.org/dist/xml/batik/">main distribution
        directory</a> , rather than from a mirror. Then verify the
        signatures using
      </p>
      <p>
	<code>
          % pgpk -a KEYS <br/>
          % pgpv batik-1.5.zip.asc<br/>
        </code>
        <em>or</em>
        <br/>
	<code>
          % pgp -ka KEYS<br/>
          % pgp batik-1.5.zip.asc<br/>
        </code>
        <em>or</em>
        <br/>
	<code>
          % gpg --import KEYS<br/>
          % gpg --verify batik-1.5.zip.asc
        </code>
      </p>
      <p>
        Alternatively, you can verify the MD5 signature on the files.
        A unix program called <code>md5</code> or <code>md5sum</code>
        is included in many unix distributions.  It is also available
        as part of <a
        href="http://www.gnu.org/software/textutils/textutils.html">GNU
        Textutils</a> .  Windows users can get binary md5 programs
        from <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/md5/">here</a> , <a
        href="http://www.pc-tools.net/win32/freeware/console/">here</a>
        , or <a href="http://www.slavasoft.com/fsum/">here</a> .
      </p>
      <p>
        The PGP signature can provide a much higher level of assurance.
