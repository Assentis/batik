    <s1 title="Introduction">
      <p>
        This page provides information about how to access Batik's
        source code.  There are four main ways:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The first, and prefered method for developers, is
          through anonymouse Subversion. Anyone can checkout source code from
          our anonymous SVN server. To do so, simply use the
          following commands (if you are using a GUI SVN client,
          configure it appropriately):<br/>
          
          <code>svn checkout http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/xmlgraphics/batik/trunk/</code>
        </li>

        <li>The second and probably easiest is by downloading a <link
            href="http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/xml/batik">source
            distribution</link>.  These are the packages that start
          with 'batik-src'.  These correspond to the major releases of
          Batik.<br/>
        </li>

        <li>The third is by downloading a <link
            href="http://svn.apache.org/builds/xml-batik">nightly
            build</link>.  The '-cvs-' packages contain a complete
          copy of CVS for a given date (before the move to Subversion).
          Snapshots of the SVN repository will be made available soon.
          The '-src-' packages contain only what is needed to build and
          run Batik.  The biggest difference being that SVN includes the
          <link href="test.html">test infrastructure</link>.<br/>
        </li>

        <li>The fourth is through <link
            href="http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/xmlgraphics/batik/"
            >viewcvs</link>.  This provides the ability to traverse
          the SVN repository over the web, and check differences
          between versions.  This is generally only useful for tracking
          a small number of files/changes.
        </li>
      </ul>
