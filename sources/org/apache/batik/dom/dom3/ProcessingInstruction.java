/**
 * The <code>ProcessingInstruction</code> interface represents a "processing 
 * instruction", used in XML as a way to keep processor-specific information 
 * in the text of the document.
 * <p> No lexical check is done on the content of a processing instruction and 
 * it is therefore possible to have the character sequence 
 * <code>"?&gt;"</code> in the content, which is illegal a processing 
 * instruction per section 2.6 of [<a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml-20040204'>XML 1.0</a>]. The 
 * presence of this character sequence must generate a fatal error during 
 * serialization. 
 * <p>See also the <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407'>Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Core Specification</a>.
