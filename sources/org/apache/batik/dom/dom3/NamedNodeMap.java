/**
 * Objects implementing the <code>NamedNodeMap</code> interface are used to 
 * represent collections of nodes that can be accessed by name. Note that 
 * <code>NamedNodeMap</code> does not inherit from <code>NodeList</code>; 
 * <code>NamedNodeMaps</code> are not maintained in any particular order. 
 * Objects contained in an object implementing <code>NamedNodeMap</code> may 
 * also be accessed by an ordinal index, but this is simply to allow 
 * convenient enumeration of the contents of a <code>NamedNodeMap</code>, 
 * and does not imply that the DOM specifies an order to these Nodes. 
 * <p><code>NamedNodeMap</code> objects in the DOM are live.
 * <p>See also the <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407'>Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Core Specification</a>.
